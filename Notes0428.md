Today we discussed the plan for the remaining 2 weeks. The team goal is to make sure everyone in the course has passed their AWS exam. Many have their exam scheduled for this upcoming weekend. After speaking with the instructors, I will host an optional exam review session for those whom have yet to take their exam. Out of the 29 members of the cohort, I believe more than 20 have taken and passed their exam.

Exam review session was a success. Many tuned in and used the time to assess where they are in terms of readiness, for the exam. Ended class today right at 4:30. Day ended with more good news that 2 more members have passed their AWS certification exam.
